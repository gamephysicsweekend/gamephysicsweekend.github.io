  <h1 id='intro'>Introduction</h1>
  
  <p>This book series was inspired by Peter Shirley's <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a>.
  His books would instruct someone, with little to no knowledge of graphics programming, to build a working homebrew path tracer.

  <p>After reading his books, I thought there should be other series similar to that for as many subjects as possible.  After all,
  when starting to learn a subject, often times the most difficult part is figuring out how to start.

  <p>The aim of <cite>Game Physics in One Weekend</cite> is to guide the reader through the process of
  building a real-time rigid body physics simulation for use in games.  It is my hope that the process of hand crafting
  your very own physics simulation will demystify the subject.
  
  <p>Since this is a book on game physics, you will need a renderer.  If you have one of your own, then excellent.
  If you do not have one, then I have a prepared a very meager Vulkan renderer.

  <p>The code in this book is written in C++.  Because this is a book with intended application in games, I’m assuming
  that you either work on games or are a student aimed at working in the industry.  And C++ is still rather ubiquitous
  for game development, so it is a natural choice for this book series.
